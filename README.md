**My Dot Files**

**.bashrc**

Bash prompt is now colorized based on environment:

Brackets and separators as follows:
- PROD/PRD - Red
- TEST/TST - Yellow
- DEV      - Green
- SAND     - Cyan
- Other    - White

Includes code to show the git branch of the current directory (if it is under git control)


**.bash_profile**
- simple redirect to my .bashrc

**.vimrc**
- includes line numbering, colorization, etc.  Nothing too fancy.

**.emacs**
- an ancient dotfile that needs to be updated.  Mostly here for historical purposes.

**.screenrc**
- Simple mode line and a few key bindings
- soon to be replaced w/tmux.  someday.  maybe.
